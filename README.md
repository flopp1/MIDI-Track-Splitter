# MIDI-Track-Splitter
Splits MIDI files into their constituent tracks and exports them into their own MIDI files. 

I made this because https://github.com/VirtuosicAI/MIDI-Splitter-Lite couldn't support MIDI files with tracks larger than 2GB, so with the help of a lot of AI I managed to rewrite it in C++ and it works. No idea how.

All credits go to VirtuosicAI for the original project because I suck at coding and couldn't have done this from scratch.
